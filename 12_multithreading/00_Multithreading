What is a CPU / Processor?
--------------------------
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the "brain" of a computer. 
It performs all the calculations and instructions needed to run programs. 
Every action you do on a computer—like opening a file, playing a video, 
or browsing the web—goes through the CPU. 
It's responsible for processing the data and commands that make things happen on your device.

What is a Process?
-------------------
A process is a program that is currently running on your computer. 
When you open an app, like a web browser or a video player, it becomes a process. 
A process takes up resources, like memory and CPU time, and runs independently, handling tasks assigned to it.

What is a Core?
---------------
A core is a part of the CPU. Modern CPUs have multiple cores, which means they can do multiple things at once. 
Each core can handle its own tasks independently, so having more cores allows your computer to run many processes simultaneously, improving performance.

What is a Thread?
-----------------
A thread is like a smaller unit of a process. Each process can have one or more threads running inside it. 
Threads share resources within the same process but can perform tasks independently, allowing for more efficient multitasking. 
For example, in a web browser, one thread might handle loading a webpage while another handles displaying the content.

In summary:
-----------
    CPU: The computer’s brain.
    Process: A running program or app.
    Core: A part of the CPU that can handle tasks.
    Thread: A smaller unit of work within a process.


STATES OF PROCESS / THREAD
--------------------------
1.New:
	A thread is in this state when it is created but not yet started.
2.Runnable (Ready):
	When start() method is called the thread become runnable / ready.
	It's ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.
3.Running:
	The thread is currently being executed by the CPU.
4.Blocked (Waiting):
	A thread is in this state when it is wating for a resource or for another thread to perform an action.
5.Terminated (Dead):
    The thread has finished its execution either by completing its task or being explicitly terminated.
