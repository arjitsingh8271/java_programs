Vector Collections in Java:
---------------------------
Vector is an implemented class of List Interface. 
Vector class methods are by default synchronized. 
It is used to store a group of individual objects where duplicate values are allowed.

Vector is exactly similar to ArrayList but ArrayList is not a synchronized class where Vector is a synchronized class. 
Vector is also called legacy class because it is available from Java 1.0 Version. 
It is similar to the ArrayList, but with two differences-

1. The vector is synchronized.
2. Java Vector contains many legacy methods that are not part of a collections framework.

Note: It is recommended to use ArrayList in place of Vector because vectors are not thread-safe and are less efficient.

Creation of Vector
Syntax : Vector<Type> vector = new Vector<Type>();
Here, Type indicates the type of Vector.

Vector Constructors
Vector<E> v = new Vector<E>();
This constructor creates a single dimension array with a default capacity of 10.

Vector<E> v = new Vector<E>(int capacity);
This constructor sets a given capacity as a current capacity to a single dimension array.

Vector<E> v = new Vector<E>(Collection obj);
This constructor is used for migrating one collection with another collection for transferring data.

Methods of Vector
We can use all Collections Method to work with the LinkedList. We can also use legacy methods like addElement(), removeElement(), setElement(),â€¦.
