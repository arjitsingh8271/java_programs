What are Collection?
---------------------
Collection: It is a mechanism of collecting some group of objects either statically or dynamically. 
Collections can hold a group of objects. 
The size of the collection is not fixed, it means when we are inserting and deleting the elements than the size of the collection dynamically increased or decreased. 
Every collection internally follows data structures and contains predefined functions it means we don't need to write new logic for performing the operations like Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting, etc.
It works with Wrapper Classes.

What is a Framework?
--------------------
The framework is a semi-finished reusable application that provides some common low-level services for serving reoccurring problems and that can be customized according to our requirements. For example:

The computer is a framework; it can be used by all people according to their requirements.
Switchboard is a framework it can be used by all people according to their requirement.


Java.util package contains several classes that collect homogeneous and heterogeneous objects without size limitation. 
These classes are usually called collection framework classes. 
All the collection classes are classified into the following four categories:

1. List: It is used to store a group of individual elements where the elements can be duplicated (e.g. ArrayList, LinkedList).
2. Set: It is used to store a group of individual elements but the elements can’t be duplicated (e.g. HashSet, TreeSet).
3. Queue: It is used to hold multiple elements prior to processing and is dedicated to storing all the elements where the order of the elements matter (e.g. Priority Queue, LinkedList when used as a queue).
4. Deque: A double-ended queue that allows insertion & deletion from both ends (e.g. ArrayDeque).
5. Map: It is used to store the element in the form of key-value pairs where the keys can’t be duplicated but values can be duplicated (e.g. HashMap, TreeMap).


Collection API :-	Concep
Collections :- 		'Class'
Collection :- 		'Interface'



Java Collection: 
----------------
	
	1. Collection Interface
	2. Map Interface
	3. Iterator


NOTE: (Interface), [Class]


(iterable)
	(collection)

		(List)
			[ArrayList]
			[LinkedList]
			[Vector]
  				[Stack] -- 'LIFO Principle'

  		(Queue)
  			[PriorityQueue]
  			(Deque)
  				[ArrayDeque]

  		(Set) -- 'Unique + No Index + Unorder'
  			[HashSet] -- 'Unique + No Index + Unorder'
  			[LinkedHashSet] -- 'Unique + No Index + Input Order'
  			(SortedSet)
  				[TreeSet] -- 'Unique + No Index + Sorted Order'

---------------------------------

(Map) -- 'Key Value pairs'
	[HashMap]
	[LinkedHashMap]
	[HashTable]	-- 'Same as HashMap + Synchronized'
	(SortedMap)
		[TreeMap]


----------------------------------

(iterator)
	[List Iterator]

Qn. Stream vs Collection
-> 	Collection: Data Structure store data in memory.
				Store, Access, and Modify data.
	Stream: Sequence of data used for comuptation.
			Process or transform data (e.g. filter, map, reduce).
