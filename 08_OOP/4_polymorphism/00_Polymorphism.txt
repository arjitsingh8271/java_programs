Polymorphism:
-------------
Polymorphism means many form. 
Means a single Method having many form.

Types of Polymorphism:
----------------------
	Compile Time :
	------------
	It will takes decision on Compile time which method to call.
	Using Method Overloading we can achive Compile Time Polymorphism.

	Run Time:
	--------
	It will takes decision on Run time which method to call.
	Using Method Overriding we can achive Run Time Polymorphism.
	(Dynamic Method Dispatch)
	
Method Overloading:
------------------
Two or more methods may have the same name if they 
differ in parameters (different number of parameters, 
different types of parameters, or both). These methods 
are called overloaded methods and this feature is called 
method overloading. 

For example:

void func() { ... }
void func(int a) { ... }
float func(double a) { ... }
float func(int a, float b) { ... }
