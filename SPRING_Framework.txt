SPRING Framework
----------------

A framework is defined as an abstraction layer on top of the existing technologies and concepts of Java.


Annotations
-----------
Annotations are a form of metadata (data about data) added to a Java source file. 
They provide additional information about the program to the compiler, but are not part of the program itself. 
Annotations are used by frameworks and libraries to simplify integration with client code.

Type of Annotations:-
@override: it indicates that a method is intended to override a method in a superclass or implement an interface method. 
It helps the compiler catch errors when a method does not actually override anything due to issues like incorrect method signatures or method name mismatches.
@Component: Marks a class as a Spring bean. The container automatically detects and registers it as a bean.
@Autowired: Injects a dependency automatically.
@Service: Marks a class as a service (specialization of @Component).
@Repository: Marks a class as a Data Access Object (DAO), used for database interactions.
@Controller: Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller (for web applications).
@Configuration: Indicates that the class contains Spring bean definitions (used to define Java-based Spring configuration).
@Bean: Used within @Configuration classes to define beans programmatically.

IOC - 'Inversion of Control'
----------------------------
It is concept for handiling 'Creating, Managing, Destroying Object'.
It is a Design Principle.
Spring Framework comes with 2 IOC Containers:
To create the object in a container by using
1. BeanFactory (Basic version of IOC Container)
2. AplicationContext (Adv. & extend BeanFactory)
AplicationContext it is a Interface.
The container is knows as 'IOC Container'
Only those Object will be created will you have @component on top of your Class.
IOC Container can configure by:
1. ClasspathXMLApplicationContext
2. AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
3. FileSystemXMLApplicationContext
4. WebApplicationContext
These all are class inplimens AplicationContext

1. ClasspathXMLApplicationContext: Loads bean definations from an XML file in the classpath.
2. AnnotationConfigApplicationContext: Loads bean definations from Java-based configuration (annotated with @Configuration).
3. FileSystemXMLApplicationContext: Loads bean definations from an XML file from the file system.
4. WebApplicationContext: A specialized version for web-based application.

DI - 'Dependincy Injection'
---------------------------
It is actual implementation of IOC.
It is a Design Pattern.
It means someone else is injecting object in our application that someone else is Spring

Three techniques for achive DI :
	1. Constructor Injection
	2. Setter Injection
	3. Field/Property Injection


Bean Scope
----------
Scop refers to lifecycle of a bean
How long does it live?
How many instances are created?
How is it shared?
	Type of Beans Scope:
		1. singleton (if two variable shared same memory location)
		2. prototype (if two variable shared different memory location)
	For web
		3. request
		4. session
		5. global-session


'Spring' is responsible of create an Object.
Any Object is created, manage by Spring is called 'Beans'
